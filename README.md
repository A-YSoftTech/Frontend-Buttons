## Description

The buttons utilize CSS animations and transitions to create an interactive neon glow effect that changes as the user hovers over them.

Each button features a unique glow and animation style, which makes the design visually striking. 
The animation effects are achieved with the help of keyframes in CSS, which move linear gradients around the button edges.

**Features:**
- Neon glow effect on hover
- Animated borders that shift direction
- Responsive design for mobile and tablet devices
- Fully written in HTML and CSS (no JavaScript required)
